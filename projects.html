          In my locality, frequent load shading is a very common problem during
         summer. I was really tired of this problem. I always wanted
          to have a mini UPS system that can power up my WiFi-Router/Modem for
          internet purposes and also charge my Smartphone. After some
          brainstorming and by using my past DIY experience, I have landed on
          this simple Mini UPS design. The best thing about this UPS is that it
          uses minimal components and it can easily fit inside my jeans pocket
          during traveling.
